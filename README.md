##DATA ANALYTICS 

This Markdown document documents the Data Analytics Project completed for a consumer electronics retailer with both bricks & mortar stores in the southeastern United States and an eCommerce site. They have recently begun to leverage the data collected from online and in-store transactions to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behavior. My job was to extend their application of data mining methods to develop predictive models.

I used machine learning methods to predict which potential new products that the sales team is considering adding to the company's current product mix will be the most profitable.  Next, I created a model to predict which brand of computer products customers prefer based on customer demographics collected from a marketing survey. Finally, I presented  a report to management, explaining my insights and suggestions for data mining process improvements.

The information was obtained by applying data mining and machine-learning techniques to make inferences about patterns in the data that will help the business make data-driven decisions about sales and marketing activities. My goal was to investigate the patterns in customer sales to provide insight into customer buying trends and preferences. 

# Customers Patterns based on demographics analysis

1.  Amount spent per transaction by Region
2.  Correlation between customer age and amount spent 
3.  Correlation between customer age and online or in-store shopping

# Cross-Selling Recommendations

1. Recommend Cross-Selling Opportunities for One Product (Acer Aspire Laptop)(Chi-Squared Test)
2. Recommend Cross-Selling Opportunities for the Complete Product List

# Predict New Products Profitability based on Similarity and IBK Analysis

1. Predict Profitability of Potential New Products Using Similarity Analysis
2. Predict Sales Volume of Each New Product Using Regression Methods (J48 Trees)
3. Apply Selected Model to Test Set to Predict Sales Volume and Calculate Profit
4. Generate Report

# Predict Customers Brand Preference
1. Create Predictive Model Using k-Nearest-Neighbor (IBk)
