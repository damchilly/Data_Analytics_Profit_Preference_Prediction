##DATA ANALYTICS 

This Markdown document documents the Data Analytics Project completed for a consumer electronics retailer with both bricks & mortar stores in the southeastern United States and an eCommerce site. They have recently begun to leverage the data collected from online and in-store transactions to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behavior. My job was to extend their application of data mining methods to develop predictive models.

I used machine learning methods to predict which potential new products that the sales team is considering adding to the company's current product mix will be the most profitable.  Next, I created a model to predict which brand of computer products customers prefer based on customer demographics collected from a marketing survey. Finally, I presented  a report to management, explaining my insights and suggestions for data mining process improvements.

The information was obtained by applying data mining and machine-learning techniques to make inferences about patterns in the data that will help the business make data-driven decisions about sales and marketing activities. My goal was to investigate the patterns in customer sales to provide insight into customer buying trends and preferences. 

# Scope
 The study focused on determining the following sales indicators:
1.  Amount spent per transaction by Region
2.	Correlation between customer age and amount spent 
3.	Correlation between customer age and online or in-store shopping
